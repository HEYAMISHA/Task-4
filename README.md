### Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm (ML)

#### Overview on Decision Tree Algorithm

- Decision Trees are a type of Supervised learning technique that can be used for both classification and Regression problems, but mostly it is preferred for solving Classification problems. 
- The tree can be explained by two entities, namely decision nodes and leaves.
- We can represent any boolean function on discrete attributes using the decision tree.
